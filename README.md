# PhenoGPT

PhenoGPT is an advanced phenotype recognition model, leveraging the robust capabilities of GPT-3. It employs a fine-tuned implementation on the publicly accessible [BiolarkGSC+ dataset](https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/IHP), to enhance prediction accuracy and alignments. Like GPT-3's broad utilization, PhenoGPT can process diverse clinical abstracts for improved flexibility. For enhanced model precision and specialization, you have the option to further fine-tune the proposed PhenoGPT model utilizing OpenAI API packages. This process is elaborated in the subsequent [section](##Fine-tuning).
