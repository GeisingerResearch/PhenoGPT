       "\"The results of a systematic study of the otological aspects in 13 cases of earpit-deafness syndrome are reported. The audiometric, radiological and vestibular findings as well as the results of exploratory tympanotomies with and without stapedectomies are discussed together with the results reported in the literature. A convincing explanation of the poor results of exploratory tympanotomies in cases with mixed hearing loss is not furnished. If the hearing loss is confined to conduction and ankylosis of the stapes or a disconnection of the ossicular chain is suspected, exploratory tympanotomy can be expected to be successful. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  TABLES\\n\\nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To demonstrate the usefulness of exploratory tympanotomy in the assessment of cases of ear pathology with hearing loss. METHODS/PROCEDURE: This retrospective study involves the examination of patients treated for ear pathology during the period from August 1994 to September 2000 at the Otolaryngology Department, ENT Clinic of University of Siena (Italy). The main symptoms and the data pertaining to diagnosis and treatment (imaging techniques - radiology and clinical examination) or diagnosis and surgical treatment (otoscopy, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials - VEMP's and air-conducted pure-tone audiometry) were recorded and analysed. The diagnosis was made clinically, when possible on the basis of the most careful anamnesis, but also by means of instrumental diagnosis. The first diagnosis was confirmed and/or modified at every exploratory tympanotomy according to the findings of the vestibular tests and/or radiogrammetry. The degree of auditory, vestibular and otic capsule integrity was also taken into consideration during surgery. The results of auditory diagnosis were evaluated on the basis of the results of surgical exploration. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated: nine of these after a medical examination and four after surgical treatment alone. The diagnosis was made clinically in eight cases. Two lesions--fibroma of the saccule and middle ear haemorrhage--were diagnosed as malignant tumours on the basis of histological examination. A unilateral perilymphatic fistula due to a chronic otitis media--otosclerosis syndrome--was diagnosed in the remaining three patients. The degree of integrity at histological examination--performed whenever possible--was always more than 90%, but at the examination performed during\""

       "['Familial Angelman syndrome (AS) can result from mutations in chromosome 15q11q13 that, when transmitted from father to child, result in no phenotypic abnormality but, when transmitted from mother to child, cause AS. These mutations therefore behave neither as dominant nor as recessive mutations but, rather, show an imprinted mode of inheritance. We have analyzed two sibling pairs with AS and a larger family with four AS offspring of three sisters with several recently described microsatellite polymorphisms in the AS region. AS siblings inherited the same maternal alleles at the GABRB3 and GABRA5 loci, and the unaffected siblings of AS individuals inherited the other maternal alleles at these loci. In one of the AS sibling pairs, analysis of a recombination event indicates that the mutation responsible for AS is distal to locus D15S63. This result is consistent with a previously described imprinted submicroscopic deletion causing AS, a deletion that includes loci D15S10, D15S113, and GABRB3, all distal to D15S63. The analysis of the larger AS family provides the first clear demonstration of a new mutation in nondeletion AS. Analysis of linkage of AS to GABRB3 in these three families, on the assumption of imprinted inheritance (i.e., penetrance of an AS mutation is 1 if transmitted maternally and is 0 if transmitted paternally), indicates a maximum lod score of 3.52 at theta = 0. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  phenotypic abnormality | HP_0000118\\n dominant | HP_0000006\\n mode of inheritance | HP_0000005\\n END',\n",
       " 'The nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by major manifestations, such as multiple basal-cell carcinomata, cysts of the jaws, and skeletal--specifically, rib--abnormalities. Findings in 53 patients and a review of the literature document both major and lesser-known manifestations of the disorder. The odontogenic keratocyst, which usually appears during adolescence, has a marked tendency to recur. In addition to the skin tumors, milia, epidermoid cysts, chalazia, comedones, and palmar and plantar pits are frequent. The skin tumors, originally thought to be independent of sun exposure, are more common in sun-exposed areas and are far less frequent and occur at a much later age in blacks than in whites. There is some evidence that radiation of the skin promotes the appearance of skin cancers in this disorder. Unilateral linear nevoid basal-cell carcinomas with comedones may represent postzygotic somatic mutation. A proclivity to other forms of neoplasia exists. Patients with this syndrome have had medulloblastoma, meningioma, ovarian fibroma, ovarian fibrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma of the jaws, cardiac fibroma, fetal rhabdomyoma, and lymphatic or chylous cysts of the mesentery. In addition to the usual modalities of treatment, topical immunotherapy and topical 5-fluorouracil have been used with success. Oral synthetic retinoids, such as 13-cis-retinoic acid, have been used to prevent new lesions from appearing and to arrest the growth of older lesions by inducing differentiation. The independent observations of increased prostaglandin levels associated both with odontogenic keratocyst expansion and aggression of basal cell cancers merit further investigation both as a fundamental cellular mechanism and as a possible basis for treatment (e.g., with antiprostaglandins). The key to pre- and early postnatal diagnosis of the disorder--as well as to an understanding of the basic abnormality--lies in molecular genetics. Prime attention should be given to finding the site of the gene through the use of DNA and other markers. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  basal-cell carcinoma | HP_0002671\\n cysts of the jaws | HP_0010603\\n skeletal--specifically | HP_0000924\\n rib--abnormalities | HP_0000772\\n appears during adolescence | HP_0003590\\n adolescence | HP_0011462\\n skin tumors | HP_0008069\\n tumors | HP_0002664\\n milia | HP_0001056\\n epidermoid cysts | HP_0200040\\n chalazia | HP_0010605\\n comedones | HP_0000951\\n palmar and plantar pits | HP_0010610\\n plantar pits | HP_0010612\\n pits | HP_0004467\\n somatic mutation | HP_0001428\\n medulloblastoma | HP_0002885\\n meningioma | HP_0002858\\n ovarian fibroma | HP_0010618\\n ovarian fibrosarcoma | HP_0000137\\n fibrosarcoma | HP_0100244\\n fibrosarcoma of the jaws | HP_0000209\\n cardiac fibroma | HP_0010617\\n rhabdomyoma | HP_0009730\\n aggression | HP_0000718\\n END',\n",

This phenotype has been mapped to two different loci on chromosomes 12q24 and 20q11.2. The latter locus contains the cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein (CDMP)1 gene, in which a null mutation has been found in patients with malformations restricted to the upper limbs. A more complex brachydactyly type C phenotype has been mapped to chromosome 12q24. Differences in complexity of these phenotypes have been attributed to locus heterogeneity. Clinical subclassification based on the degree of complexity of the phenotype has therefore been suggested. We present patients with a complex brachydactyly type C phenotype in whom there is considerable intra- and interfamilial variability in expression. We show that clinical subclassification based on the complexity of the brachydactyly type C phenotype related to the genetic defect is not feasible.

       " 'Six patients, including two sibs, with Angelman syndrome (AS; three females and three males, aged 11 to 18 years) were studied cytogenetically. Molecular analysis was also performed. Using high-resolution banding technique, we detected a microdeletion in the proximal region of chromosome 15q in four cases. The deleted segment was heterogenous between these patients, and the common deleted region appeared to be 15q11.2. Four patients with deleted 15q were all sporadic cases, whereas in the sib cases we could not detect a visible deletion in the long arm of chromosome 15. However, there was no clinical difference between sporadic cases and sib cases. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographic bands of Southern hybridization using two DNA segments, pML34 and pTD3-21, as probes demonstrated that two patients had only one copy for each of the probes. In the remaining four patients, including the sibs, two copies of each sequence were retained. The probes used here detect a molecular deletion in most Prader-Willi syndrome patients. Thus the segment causing AS is localized adjacent to the critical segment of Prader-Willi syndrome. There seemed to be heterogeneity for the molecular deletion within AS individuals. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  sporadic | HP_0003745\\n heterogeneity | HP_0001425\\n END',\n",
       " 'A pedigree of branchio-oto-renal dysplasia (the BOR syndrome) is reported, including the documentation by serial audiometric studies of the onset and rapid progression of hearing loss in the twin sister of an affected child. The literature on this syndrome is analyzed to derive some figures for use in genetic counseling of such families. Branchio-oto-renal dysplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder in which affected individuals may have preauricular pits, lachrymal duct stenosis, hearing loss, branchial fistulas or cysts, structural defects of the outer, middle, and inner ear, and renal anomalies, which may range from mild hypoplasia to complete absence. Not all features of the syndrome are expressed in all carriers of the gene, but few carriers lack all the features, and the pits, branchial clefts, and hearing loss, are frequently expressed. Those offspring of affected persons who have pits or fistulas are likely (about 80%) to have hearing loss of varying degrees of severity. A minority of heterozygotes (about 7%) may have hearing loss without pits or fistulas. The risk of severe renal malformation is probably fairly low. Whether families that show dominant inheritance of pits, clefts, and deafness without renal anomalies represent variants of the BOR syndrome or a separate entity (the BO syndrome), is still not clear. At present, any individual with preauricular pits and branchial clefts deserves both otologic and renal investigation. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  renal dysplasia | HP_0000110\\n rapid progression | HP_0003678\\n hearing loss | HP_0000365\\n autosomal dominant | HP_0000006\\n preauricular pits | HP_0004467\\n lachrymal duct stenosis | HP_0007925\\n branchial fistulas or cysts | HP_0009796\\n branchial | HP_0009794\\n branchial fistulas | HP_0009795\\n structural defects of the outer, middle, and inner ear | HP_0000598\\n renal anomalies | HP_0000077\\n renal malformation | HP_0000792\\n deafness | HP_0000404\\n END',\n",
       " 'Growth/differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) is a secreted growth factor that plays a key regulatory role in embryonic skeletal and joint development. Mutations in the GDF5 gene can cause different types of skeletal dysplasia, including brachydactyly type C (BDC) and proximal symphalangism (SYM1). We report two novel mutations in the GDF5 gene in Chinese families with distinct limb malformations. In one family affected with BDC, we identified a novel nonsense mutation, c.1461T > G (p.Y487X), which is predicted to truncate the GDF5 precursor protein by deleting 15 amino acids at its C-terminus. In one family with SYM1, we found a novel missense mutation, c.1118T > G (p.L373R), which changes a highly conserved amino acid in the prodomain of GDF5. We transfected COS-7 cells with retroviral constructs to express human wild-type or mutant GDF5 cDNAs. The mature GDF5 protein was detected, as in the wild-type, in supernatant derived from the p.L373R mutant GDF5 transfected cells, but not in the supernatant from the p.Y487X mutant transfected cells, indicating that the two mutations led to different fates of the mutant GDF5 proteins, thereby producing distinct limb phenotypes. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  skeletal dysplasia | HP_0002652\\n brachydactyly | HP_0001156\\n brachydactyly type C | HP_0009373\\n proximal symphalangism | HP_0100264\\n limb malformations | HP_0002813\\n END',\n",
       " 'Gorlin syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, medulloblastomas, ovarian fibromas, and a variety of developmental defects. All affected individuals share certain key features, but there is significant phenotypic variability within and among kindreds with respect to malformations. The gene (NBCCS) maps to chromosome 9q22, and allelic loss at this location is common in tumors from Gorlin syndrome patients. Two recessive cancer-predisposition syndromes, xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPAC) and Fanconi anemia group C (FACC), map to the NBCCS region; and unusual, dominant mutations in these genes have been proposed as the cause of Gorlin syndrome. This study presents cytogenetic and molecular characterization of germ-line deletions in one patient with a chromosome 9q22 deletion and in a second patient with a deletion of 9q22-q3l. Both have typical features of Gorlin syndrome plus additional findings, including mental retardation, conductive hearing loss, and failure to thrive. That Gorlin syndrome can be caused by null mutations (deletions) rather than by activating mutations has several implications. First, in conjunction with previous analyses of allelic loss in tumors, this study provides evidence that associated neoplasms arise with homozygous inactivation of the gene. In addition, dominant mutations of the XPAC and FACC1 genes can be ruled out as the cause of Gorlin syndrome, since the two patients described have null mutations. Finally, phenotypic features that show variable expression must be influenced by genetic background, epigenetic effects, somatic mutations, or environmental factors, since these two patients with identical alterations (deletions) of the Gorlin syndrome gene have somewhat different manifestations of Gorlin syndrome. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  autosomal dominant | HP_0000006\\n basal cell carcinomas | HP_0002671\\n medulloblastomas | HP_0002885\\n ovarian fibromas | HP_0010618\\n developmental defects | HP_0001263\\n significant phenotypic variability within and among kindreds | HP_0003822\\n phenotypic variability | HP_0003812\\n tumors | HP_0002664\\n mental retardation | HP_0001249\\n conductive hearing loss | HP_0000405\\n hearing loss | HP_0000365\\n failure to thrive | HP_0001508\\n variable | HP_0003813\\n variable expression | HP_0003828\\n END',\n",
       " 'The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene has been hypothesized to be a recessive tumor suppressor, with mutations at the same locus on chromosome 22 that lead to NF2 also leading to sporadic tumors of the types seen in NF2. Flanking markers for this gene have previously been defined as D22S1 centromeric and D22S28 telomeric. Identification of subregions of this interval that are consistently rearranged in the NF2-related tumors would aid in better defining the disease locus. To this end, we have compared tumor and constitutional DNAs, isolated from 39 unrelated patients with sporadic and NF2-associated acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, schwannomas, and ependymomas, at eight polymorphic loci on chromosome 22. Two of the tumors studied revealed loss-of-heterozygosity patterns, which is consistent with the presence of chromosome 22 terminal deletions. By using additional polymorphic markers, the terminal deletion breakpoint found in one of the tumors, an acoustic neuroma from an NF2 patient, was mapped within the previously defined NF2 region. The breakpoint occurred between the haplotyped markers D22S41/D22S46 and D22S56. This finding redefines the proximal flanking marker and localizes the NF2 gene between markers D22S41/D22S46 and D22S28. In addition, we identified a sporadic acoustic neuroma that reveals a loss-of-heterozygosity pattern consistent with mitotic recombination or deletion and reduplication, which are mechanisms not previously seen in studies of these tumors. This finding, while inconsistent with models of tumorigenesis that invoke single deletions and their gene-dosage effects, lends further support to the recessive tumor-suppressor model. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  neurofibromatosis | HP_0006746\\n tumor | HP_0002664\\n sporadic | HP_0003745\\n acoustic neuromas | HP_0009588\\n meningiomas | HP_0002858\\n schwannomas | HP_0100008\\n ependymomas | HP_0002888\\n END',\n",

       " 'Gorlin syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes to basal cell carcinomas of the skin, ovarian fibromas, and medulloblastomas. Unlike other hereditary disorders associated with cancer, it features widespread developmental defects. To investigate the possibility that the syndrome is caused by mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, we searched for loss of heterozygosity in 16 sporadic basal cell carcinomas, 2 hereditary basal cell carcinomas, and 1 hereditary ovarian fibroma and performed genetic linkage studies in five Gorlin syndrome kindreds. Eleven sporadic basal cell carcinomas and all 3 hereditary tumors had allelic loss of chromosome 9q31, and all informative kindreds showed tight linkage between the Gorlin syndrome gene and a genetic marker in this region. Loss of heterozygosity at this chromosomal location, particularly in hereditary tumors, implies that the gene is homozygously inactivated and normally functions as a tumor suppressor.

In this study, a large five-generation Chinese family with BDA1 was identified and characterized. All affected family members demonstrated significant homogeneous phenotype and some unique clinical features different from those associated with the reported BDA1 mutations in IHH. Linkage analysis showed that the BDA1 gene in the family was linked to marker D2S126 close to IHH with a LOD score of 4.74 at a recombination fraction of 0. DNA sequence analysis revealed a heterozygous C to T transition at nucleotide 461 of IHH, resulting in a novel T154I substitution. The T154I mutation co-segregated with all affected individuals in the family, and was not present in normal family members or 200 normal controls.

       " 'The application of recombinant DNA techniques has identified two fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis in man. The first involves a qualitative or quantitative change in an oncogene (see ref. 1 for review). In the second, discovered in embryonal tumours, a primary mutation occurs which is recessive at the cellular level to the normal allele. The growth of a tumour ensues only after a secondary change, such as chromosome loss or mitotic recombination, eliminates the normal allele, thereby unmasking the altered allele. Because its effect is recessive, the primary mutation may also occur and be transmitted in the germ line, resulting in a familial pattern for the disease. In familial cases, independent bilateral tumours are common, since the tumours result from a single event--loss of the normal genes--which can occur in any cell. This contrasts with non-familial (sporadic) cases where solitary tumours result from the infrequent occurrence of two rare events within the same cell. By a molecular genetic approach we have now shown that acoustic neuroma, one of the most common tumours of the human nervous system, is specifically associated with loss of genes on human chromosome 22 and may result from the mechanism of tumorigenesis discovered in embryonal tumours. This finding might provide a clue to the chromosomal location of the defective gene in bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, an autosomal dominant disorder with the hallmark of bilateral acoustic neuromas. In view of the frequent occurrence of meningiomas in patients with bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis and the association of meningioma with loss of chromosome 22 previously reported in cytogenetic studies, we suggest that a common event underlies tumorigenesis in acoustic neuroma and meningioma. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  tumours | HP_0002664\\n sporadic | HP_0003745\\n acoustic neuroma | HP_0009588\\n tumours of the human nervous system | HP_0004375\\n bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis | HP_0009589\\n neurofibromatosis | HP_0006746\\n autosomal dominant disorder | HP_0000006\\n meningiomas | HP_0002858\\n END',\n",

It is characterized by developmental anomalies and predisposition to tumors (for example, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma). PTCH1, the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene, was identified as a gene responsible for BCNS. The PTCH1 protein is a Hedgehog (Hh) protein receptor and is pivotal for early development, stem cell maintenance and/or differentiation. We analyzed the six Japanese families with BCNS and identified six germline mutations in the PTCH1 gene. One family had a nonsense mutation (c.1196G>A), one had a 1-bp deletion (c.2029delA), two had 2-bp deletions (c.239_240delGA and c.1670_1671delCA) and one had a 58-bp duplication (c.1138_1195dup). They caused premature termination, resulting in the truncation of the PTCH1 protein. Analysis of a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping array showed a large approximately 1.2-Mb deletion, including the PTCH1 gene in one allele, in a family in which PTCH1 mutations were not identified at the sequence level. These data indicated that all the six families who were diagnosed with BCNS had mutations in the PTCH1 gene and that a single copy of a PTCH1 mutation causes BCNS. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  Basal cell nevus | HP_0002671\\n autosomal dominant | HP_0000006\\n tumors | HP_0002664\\n medulloblastoma | HP_0002885\\n END',\n",

We studied 15 affected male and 8 affected female members of one large kindred with neurofibromatosis 2. None of the patients met the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis 1.

We evaluated genotype-phenotype correlations, with particular focus on the location of splice site mutations, using mutation and clinical information on 831 patients from 528 NF2 families with identified constitutional NF2 mutations. The clinical characteristics examined were age at onset of symptoms of NF2 and number of intracranial meningiomas, which are the primary indices of the severity of NF2. Two regression models were used to analyse genotype-phenotype correlations. People with splice site mutations in exons 1-5 had more severe disease than those with splice site mutations in exons 11-15. This result is compatible with studies showing that exons 2 and 3 are required for self-association of the amino terminal of the NF2 protein in vitro, and that deletions of exons 2 and 3 in transgenic and knockout mouse models of NF2 cause a high prevalence of Schwann cell derived tumours. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  Neurofibromatosis | HP_0006746\\n variability | HP_0003812\\n intracranial meningiomas | HP_0100009\\n meningiomas | HP_0002858\\n Schwann cell derived tumours | HP_0100008\\n tumours | HP_0002664\\n END',\n",

Here, we describe the phenotypic and behavioral variability detected in 49 patients with different classes of deletions and nine patients with UPD. Diagnosis was made by methylation pattern analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN-SNURF gene and by microsatellite profiling of loci within and outside the 15q11-q13 region. There were no major phenotypic differences between the two main classes (BP1-BP3; BP2-BP3) of AS deletion patients, except for the absence of vocalization, more prevalent in patients with BP1-BP3 deletions, and for the age of sitting without support, which was lower in patients with BP2-BP3 deletions. Our data suggest that gene deletions (NIPA1, NIPA2, CYF1P1, GCP5) mapped to the region between breakpoints BP1 and BP2 may be involved in the severity of speech impairment, since all BP1-BP3 deletion patients showed complete absence of vocalization, while 38.1% of the BP2-BP3 deletion patients were able to pronounce syllabic sounds, with doubtful meaning.

Recognizing neurofibromatosis-2-related skin tumors is therefore important for early diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2, especially in pediatric patients. In this study, we examined 40 skin tumors (36 schwannomas and four neurofibromas) from 20 neurofibromatosis 2 patients for NF2 mutations and allelic loss. NF2 mutations have been identified in blood from 15 (75%) of the 20 patients. We found NF2 mutations in five (13%) and NF2 allelic loss in 18 (45%) of the 40 analyzed tumors. Genetic alterations (allelic loss or mutation) were thus found in 50 (63%) out of the total of 80 examined alleles. In 17 (43%) tumors, alterations were found on both NF2 alleles. These results suggest that, as in the case of vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas, loss of functional NF2 gene product is also the critical event in the development of skin schwannomas. Identification of genetic alterations of the NF2 gene in skin tumors may help to identify neurofibromatosis-2-associated skin tumors, thus assisting in the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2 in ambiguous cases, and excluding neurofibromatosis 1 in unclear cases.

Families such as these, in which a defined subset of the NF phenotype is passed on, are important for understanding the functional consequences of particular mutations in the NF genes. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  neurofibromatosis | HP_0006746\\n spinal neurofibromas | HP_0009735\\n neurofibromas | HP_0001067\\n cafÃ© au lait spots (CLS | HP_0000957\\n  cutaneous tumor | HP_0008069\\n  tumor | HP_0002664\\n  Lisch nodule | HP_0009737\\n  acoustic tumor | HP_0009588\\n  autosomal dominant inheritanc | HP_0000006\\n END',\n",

Within and between families, the phenotype displays striking variability. Recently, the disease-causing gene for TBS was identified as SALL1, a zinc finger transcription factor. Here, we report a three-generation family with seven affected individuals who have a novel SALL1 mutation. Unique cardiac anomalies seen in this family include lethal truncus arteriosus in one patient and a lethal complicated defect, including pulmonary valve atresia, in a second patient. These severe cardiac anomalies have not previously been reported in a familial case of TBS. This family and a review of the literature indicate that cardiac evaluation is warranted in all individuals with this disorder. In addition, hypoplastic thumbs were seen in two individuals in this family and should, therefore, be considered a true feature of TBS. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  imperforate anus | HP_0002023\\n hand anomalies | HP_0001155\\n ear malformations | HP_0000598\\n sensorineural hearing loss | HP_0000407\\n hearing loss | HP_0000365\\n sporadic | HP_0003745\\n Within and between families, the phenotype displays striking variability | HP_0003822\\n variability | HP_0003812\\n cardiac anomalies | HP_0001627\\n truncus arteriosus | HP_0001660\\n pulmonary valve atresia | HP_0005134\\n hypoplastic thumbs | HP_0009778\\n END',\n",

The aim was to test these patients for deletion of chromosome 15(q11-13) and to describe the adult phenotype. The selection criteria included severe intellectual disability, ataxic or hypermotoric limb movements, lack of speech, a \"happy\" demeanour, epilepsy, and facial appearance consistent with the diagnosis. Patients were examined, medical records perused, and patients\\' doctors contacted as required. Genetic tests performed included routine cytogenetics, DNA methylation analysis (with probe PW71B), and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (with probes D15S10, GABRbeta3, or SNRPN). A deletion in the AS region was detected in 11 patients (9 males and 2 females) of 22 tested. The mean age at last review (March 1996) was 31.5 years (range 24 to 36 years). Clinical assessment documented findings of large mouth and jaw with deep set eyes, and microcephaly in nine patients (two having a large head size for height). No patient was hypopigmented; 1/11 patients was fair. Outbursts of laughter occurred in all patients but infrequently in 7/11 (64%) and a constant happy demeanour was present in 5/11 (46%). All had epilepsy, with improvement in 5/11 (46%), no change in 4 (36%), and deterioration in 2 (18%). The EEG was abnormal in 10/10 patients. Ocular abnormalities were reported in 3/8 patients (37.5%) and 4/11 (36%) had developed kyphosis. Two had never walked. All nine who walked were ataxic with an awkward, clumsy, heavy, and/or lilting gait. No patient had a single word of speech but one patient could use sign language for two needs (food and drink). Our data support the concept that AS resulting from deletion is a severe neurological syndrome in adulthood. The diagnosis in adults may not be straightforward as some manifestations change with age.

We describe a particularly instructive case which raises important issues concerning the mechanisms producing uniparental disomy and whose evaluation provides evidence that trisomy may precede uniparental disomy in a fetus. Chorionic villus sampling performed for advanced maternal age revealed trisomy 15 in all direct and cultured cells, though the fetus appeared normal. Chromosome analysis of amniocytes obtained at 15 wk was normal in over 100 cells studied. The child was hypotonic at birth, and high-resolution banding failed to reveal the deletion of 15q11-13, a deletion which is found in 50%-70% of patients with PWS. Over time, typical features of PWS developed. Molecular genetic analysis using probes for chromosome 15 revealed maternal disomy. Maternal nondisjunction with fertilization of a disomic egg by a normal sperm, followed by loss of the paternal 15, is a likely cause of confined placental mosaicism and uniparental disomy in this case of PWS, and advanced maternal age may be a predisposing factor. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  hypotonic at birth | HP_0008935\\n END',\n",

EYA1 mutations were identified in 82% (14/17) of the probands. We also describe a novel recurrent EYA1 mutation c.867 + 5G > A found in five unrelated affected patients.

The aberrant transcript was present at approximately 50% level of wild-type EYA1 mRNA in fibroblasts, and is predicted to encode an EYA1 protein retaining the amino terminal transcriptional coactivator region but lacking the conserved carboxy terminal Eya phosphatase domain. Patients with the c.867 + 5G > A mutation were found to have more severe renal abnormalities than probands with other mutations in this cohort.

Polymorphic DNA markers have revealed frequent loss of one copy of chromosome 22 in the tumor types associated with NF2. Family studies have demonstrated that the primary defect in NF2 is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 22, suggesting that it involves inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. We have employed a combination of multipoint linkage analysis and examination of deletions in primary tumor specimens to precisely map the NF2 locus between flanking polymorphic DNA markers on chromosome 22. The 13-cM region bracketed by these markers corresponds to 13% of the genetic length of the long arm of chromosome 22 and is expected to contain less than 5 x 10(6) bp of DNA.

       " 'Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by the development of vestibular schwannomas and other tumors of the nervous system, including cranial and spinal meningiomas, schwannomas, and ependymomas. The presence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas is sufficient for the diagnosis. Skin manifestations are less common than in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; von Recklinghausen disease). The apparent clinical distinction between NF1 and NF2 has been confirmed at the level of the gene locus by linkage studies; the gene for NF1 maps to chromosome 17, whereas the gene for NF2 has been assigned (in a single family) to chromosome 22. To increase the precision of the genetic mapping of NF2 and to determine whether additional susceptibility loci exist, we have performed linkage analysis on 12 families with NF2 by using four polymorphic markers from chromosome 22 and a marker at the NF1 locus on chromosome 17. Our results confirm the assignment of the gene for NF2 to chromosome 22 and do not support the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity. We believe that chromosome 22 markers can now be used for presymptomatic diagnosis in selected families. The NF2 gene is tightly linked to the D22S32 locus (maximum lod score 4.12; recombination fraction 0). A CA-repeat polymorphism at the CRYB2 locus was the most informative marker in our families (lod score 5.99), but because the observed recombination fraction between NF2 and CRYB2 was 10 cM, predictions using this marker will need to be interpreted with caution. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  Neurofibromatosis | HP_0006746\\n autosomal dominant | HP_0000006\\n vestibular schwannomas | HP_0009588\\n schwannomas | HP_0100008\\n other tumors | HP_0003008\\n tumors | HP_0002664\\n tumors of the nervous system | HP_0004375\\n cranial and spinal meningiomas | HP_0100009\\n spinal meningiomas | HP_0100010\\n meningiomas | HP_0002858\\n ependymomas | HP_0002888\\n bilateral vestibular schwannomas | HP_0009589\\n Skin manifestations | HP_0000951\\n genetic heterogeneity | HP_0001425\\n END',\n",

In 20%, the diagnosis remains clinical, but often there is uncertainty about the correctness of the clinical diagnosis and alternative diagnoses may be investigated. In evaluating individuals for AS in our center since 1989, we have encountered several mimicking conditions, and additional ones have been reported in the literature. Mimicking conditions can be grouped into the areas of chromosome, single gene, and symptom complex anomalies. Microdeletions or microduplications include chromosome regions 2,4,17, 22, and 15.

Age at diagnosis, intracranial meningiomas, and type of treatment center were informative predictors of the risk of mortality. In Cox models, the relative risk of mortality increased 1.13-fold per year decrease in age at diagnosis (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.18) and was 2.51-fold greater in people with meningiomas compared with those without meningiomas (95% CI 1.38-4.57). The relative risk of mortality in patients treated at specialty centers was 0.34 compared with those treated at nonspecialty centers (95% CI 0.12-0.98). In a separate model, the relative risk of mortality in people with constitutional NF2 missense mutations was very low compared with those with other types of mutations (nonsense or frameshift mutations, splice-site mutations, and large deletions), but the CI could not be well quantified because there was only one death among people with missense mutations. We conclude that age at diagnosis, the strongest single predictor of the risk of mortality, is a useful index for patient counseling and clinical management (as are intracranial meningiomas). To ensure optimal care, we recommend that people with NF2 be referred to specialty treatment centers. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  neurofibromatosis | HP_0006746\\n intracranial meningiomas | HP_0100009\\n meningiomas | HP_0002858\\n END',\n",

We report here the identification of the ancestral gene ( HERC2 ) and a family of duplicated, truncated copies that comprise these low-copy repeats. This gene encodes a highly conserved giant protein, HERC2, that is distantly related to p532 (HERC1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) implicated in vesicular trafficking. The mouse genome contains a single Herc2 locus, located in the jdf2 (juvenile development and fertility-2) interval of chromosome 7C. We have identified single nucleotide splice junction mutations in Herc2 in three independent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced jdf2 mutant alleles, each leading to exon skipping with premature termination of translation and/or deletion of conserved amino acids. Therefore, mutations in Herc2 lead to the neuromuscular secretory vesicle and sperm acrosome defects, other developmental abnormalities and juvenile lethality of jdf2 mice. Combined, these findings suggest that HERC2 is an important gene encoding a GEF involved in protein trafficking and degradation pathways in the cell. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  developmental abnormalities | HP_0001263\\n juvenile lethality | HP_0004149\\n END',\n",

All classical patients from these classes exhibit four cardinal features, including severe developmental delay and/or mental retardation, profound speech impairment, a movement and balance disorder, and AS specific behaviour typified by an easily excitable personality with an inappropriately happy affect.

       " 'The causal heterogeneity of Angelman syndrome (AS) makes providing information regarding recurrence risk both important and challenging, and may have a dramatic impact on reproductive decision-making for the nuclear and extended family. Most cases of AS result from typical large de novo deletions of 15q11-q13, and are expected to have a low (<1%) risk of recurrence. AS due to paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), which occurs in the absence of a parental translocation, is likewise expected to have a <1% risk of recurrence. Parental transmission of a structurally or functionally unbalanced chromosome complement can lead to 15q11-q13 deletions or to UPD and will result in case-specific recurrence risks. In instances where there is no identifiable large deletion or UPD, the risk for recurrence may be as high as 50% as the result of either a maternally inherited imprinting center (IC) mutation or a ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBE3A) gene mutation. Individuals with AS who have none of the above abnormalities comprise a significant proportion of cases, and some may be at a 50% recurrence risk.

At a de novo frequency of approximately.67-1/10,000 births, these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster. Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions. Analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the END repeats) at or near the breakpoints. The END-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues. One of five PWS/AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable, rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event. We postulate that the END repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion.

The gene encoding IRF6 is located in the critical region for the Van der Woude syndrome (VWS; OMIM 119300) locus at chromosome 1q32-q41 (refs 2,3).

Phenotypic overlap and linkage data suggest that these two disorders are allelic. We found a nonsense mutation in IRF6 in the affected twin of a pair of monozygotic twins who were discordant for VWS. Subsequently, we identified mutations in IRF6 in 45 additional unrelated families affected with VWS and distinct mutations in 13 families affected with PPS. Expression analyses showed high levels of Irf6 mRNA along the medial edge of the fusing palate, tooth buds, hair follicles, genitalia and skin.

Mean age-at-onset in 58 individuals was 20.3 years; initial symptoms resulted from vestibular schwannomas (44.4%), other CNS tumors (22.2%), skin tumors (12.7%), and ocular manifestations including cataracts and retinal hamartomas (12.7%). Five asymptomatic individuals were diagnosed through screening.

Usually, clinical manifestations and course were similar within families but differed among families. To assess possible heterogeneity, we assigned affected individuals to three proposed subtypes (representing mild, intermediate, and severe NF2) based on age-at-onset, presence or absence of CNS tumors other than vestibular schwannomas, and presence or absence of retinal hamartomas. Comparisons among the three subtypes for many clinical parameters demonstrated that patients in the mild subtype differed from those in the other two subtypes for most parameters, but that none of the parameters distinguished patients in the intermediate subtype from those in the severe subtype. Thus, there are likely two rather than three subtypes of NF2.

       " 'Angelman syndrome (AS), characterized by mental retardation, seizures, frequent smiling and laughter, and abnormal gait, is one of the best examples of human disease in which genetic imprinting plays a role. In about 70% of cases, AS is caused by de novo maternal deletions at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Approximately 2% of AS cases are caused by paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 (ref. 3) and 2-3% are caused by \"imprinting mutations\\'. In the remaining 25% of AS cases, no deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), or methylation abnormality is detectable, and these cases, unlike deletions or UPD, can be familial. These cases are likely to result from mutations in a gene that is expressed either exclusively or preferentially from the maternal chromosome 15. We have found that a 15q inversion inherited by an AS child from her normal mother disrupts the 5\\' end of the UBE3A (E6-AP) gene, the product of which functions in protein ubiquitination. We have looked for novel UBE3A mutations in nondeletion/non-UPD/non-imprinting mutation (NDUI) AS patients and have found one patient who is heterozygous for a 5-bp de novo tandem duplication. We have also found in two brothers a heterozygous mutation, an A to G transition that creates a new 3\\' splice junction 7 bp upstream from the normal splice junction. Both mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift and premature termination of translation. Our results demonstrate that UBE3A mutations are one cause of AS and indicate a possible abnormality in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during brain development in this disease. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  mental retardation | HP_0001249\\n seizures | HP_0001250\\n frequent smiling and laughter | HP_0000749\\n laughter | HP_0000748\\n abnormal gait | HP_0001288\\n de novo | HP_0003745\\n END',\n",

       " 'Angelman syndrome is a neurogenetic disorder caused by the loss of function of the imprinted UBE3A gene in 15q11-q13. In a small group of patients, the disease is due to an imprinting defect (ID) that silences the maternal UBE3A allele. The presence of a faint maternal band detected by methylation-specific PCR analysis of the SNURF-SNRPN locus in approximately one-third of patients who have an ID but no imprinting center deletion suggested that these patients are mosaics of ID cells and normal cells. In two patients studied, somatic mosaicism was proven by molecular and cellular cloning, respectively. X inactivation studies of cloned fibroblasts from one patient suggest that ID occurred before the blastocyst stage. To quantify the degree of mosaicism, we developed a novel quantitative methylation assay based on real-time PCR. In 24 patients tested, the percentage of normal cells ranged from <1% to 40%. Regression analysis suggests that patients with a higher percentage of normally methylated cells tend to have milder clinical symptoms than patients with a lower percentage.

Because the DAs are genetically heterogeneous, we sought additional candidate genes by examining modifiers of mutant Drosophila isoforms of TnI. One of these modifiers, Tm2, encodes tropomyosin, another component of the Tc-Tm complex. A human homologue of Tm2, TPM2, encodes beta-tropomyosin and maps to the critical interval of DA type 1 (DA1). We discovered that DA1 is caused by substitution of a highly conserved amino acid residue in beta-tropomyosin. These findings suggest that DAs, in general, may be caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins of the contractile apparatus specific to fast-twitch myofibers.

Homozygous CDMP-1 mutations cause Hunter-Thompson and Grebe types of acromesomelic chondrodysplasia and DuPan syndrome in humans, as well as brachypodism in mice, while heterozygous mutations cause brachydactyly type C (BDC). We present clinical and radiographic data from three unrelated families in which 12 members share the same heterozygous CDMP-1 mutation, an insertion (insG206), resulting in a frameshift predicted to cause functional haploinsufficiency. Although eight mutation carriers display BDC, four have normal hands and feet, confirming nonpenetrance of BDC with CDMP-1 mutations. In addition, several carriers have other skeletal abnormalities, including severe bilateral vertical talus (in two), developmental hip dysplasia (in one), and short stature (in two, who are otherwise unaffected). Premature vertebral end-plate disease was observed in four mutation carriers and was associated with spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in three of these. Axial skeletal involvement has not been previously reported in association with CDMP-1 mutations. This finding is consistent with CDMP-1 expression in human hypertrophic chondrocytes, which are present in the ring epiphyses of vertebral end plates. Phenotypic variation in BDC has previously been attributed either to locus heterogeneity or to the varied functional effects of different CDMP-1 mutations. The remarkable range of phenotypes caused by this identical CDMP-1 mutation in these families emphasizes the crucial role of genetic background, stochastic variation and/or environmental factors in modifying the observed phenotype. Our findings illustrate that nonpenetrance for the typical features of BDC can be appreciable and that atypical skeletal features that have been reported in some patients with BDC (i.e., clubfoot, short stature, spondylolysis) may also result from CDMP-1 mutation. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  brachydactyly | HP_0001156\\n brachydactyly type C | HP_0009373\\n nonpenetrance | HP_0003829\\n skeletal abnormalities | HP_0000924\\n vertical talus | HP_0001838\\n developmental hip dysplasia | HP_0001385\\n short stature | HP_0004322\\n Premature vertebral end-plate disease | HP_0008419\\n spondylolysis | HP_0003304\\n spondylolisthesis | HP_0003302\\n Axial skeletal involvement | HP_0009121\\n Phenotypic variation | HP_0003812\\n locus heterogeneity | HP_0001425\\n clubfoot | HP_0001762\\n END',\n",

In order to examine the phenotypic variability in NBCCS and to highlight functionally important domains of the PTCH protein, we have now screened 71 unrelated NBCCS individuals for mutations in the PTCH exons. We identified 28 mutations that are distributed throughout the entire gene, and most (86%) cause protein truncation. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate that failure of one NBCCS family to show clear linkage to chromosome 9q22.3-31 is most likely due to germinal mosaicism. We have identified three families bearing identical mutations with variable phenotypes, suggesting phenotypic variability in NBCCS is a complex genetic event. No phenotype genotype correlation between the position of truncation mutations and major clinical features was evident. Two missense mutations have been identified, and their location within transmembrane domains supports the notion that PTCH may have a transport function. The preponderance of truncation mutants in the germ line of NBCCS patients suggests that the developmental defects associated with the disorder are most likely due to haploinsufficiency. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  basal cell carcinoma | HP_0002671\\n sporadic | HP_0003745\\n phenotypic variability | HP_0003812\\n variable phenotypes | HP_0003813\\n developmental defects | HP_0001263\\n END',\n",

FISH analysis confirmed a disease-associated germinal deletion on 22q which encompassed the NEFH locus, which is known to be very closely linked to NF2, but did not extend as far as the proximal Ewing sarcoma region or the distal leukaemia factor (LIF) locus. PFGE analysis with a LIF cosmid subclone identified patient-specific NotI and MluI fragments and suggested that the deletion is about 700 kb in length.

       " 'Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes are 2 clinically distinct disorders associated with multiple anomalies and mental retardation. They are only discussed together because they share a similar and uncommon genetic basis: they involve genes that are located in the same region in the genome and are characterized by genetic imprinting. This normal process has contributed to these 2 complex and severe conditions through inactivation of 1 copy of the genes relevant to each disorder: the maternally derived copy of genes for Prader-Willi syndrome in proximal 15q are normally silent, and a paternally derived copy of 1 gene for Angelman syndrome in 15q is normally silent. For both disorders, when the normally active copy of the gene or genes is missing, abnormality results. Since the genes for these 2 disorders are located very close together, and since the center involved in inactivating the genes involved in imprinting may be the same, both these disorders usually result from the same chromosomal deletion; which disorder results depends on the parent of origin of the chromosome 15 that becomes deleted. Both Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome can also occur as a result of having both members of the chromosome 15 pair derived from 1 parent, a condition known as uniparental disomy. Both can also result from a structural abnormality of the imprinting center, known as an imprinting mutation. In addition, Angelman syndrome can be caused by a mutation in the gene that causes it; a comparable cause is not present in Prader-Willi syndrome since it results from abnormality in more than 1 gene. Finally, despite the complexity of possible causes, all but the single gene mutation of the Angelman syndrome gene can be detected through methylation-sensitive DNA probes, since DNA methylation is the process by which the genes for these 2 disorders are imprinted. This unusual property of specific areas of the DNA holds promise for future treatment of these and other disorders related to imprinting through reversal of the imprinting process. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  mental retardation | HP_0001249\\n END',\n",

A YAC contig of 1-1.5 Mb encompassing four markers (ML34, IR4-3R, PW71, and TD189-1) was constructed. Multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of interphase nuclei was combined with YAC contig information to provide the following order of markers: cen-IR39-ML34-IR4-3R-PW71-TD189-1-LS6++ +-1-TD3-21-GABRB3-IR10-1-CMW1-tel. FISH analysis was performed on 8 cases of PWS and 3 cases of AS, including 5 patients with normal karyotypes. All eleven patients were deleted for YACs in the interval from IR4-3R to GABRB3. On the proximal side of the deletion interval, 10/10 breakpoints fell within a single ML34 YAC of 370 kb. On the distal side, 8/9 breakpoints fell within a single IR10-1 YAC of 200 kb. These results indicate a striking consistency in the location of the proximal and distal breakpoints in PWS and AS patients. FISH analysis on a previously reported case of familial AS confirmed a submicroscopic deletion including YACs corresponding to LS6-1, TD3-21 and GABRB3 and supports the separation of the PWS and AS critical regions. Since these three YACs do not overlap each other, the minimum size of the AS critical region is > or = 650 kb. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  mental retardation | HP_0001249\\n familial AS | HP_0000005\\n END',\n",

       " 'Angelman syndrome is a neurological disorder whose symptoms include severe mental retardation, loss of motor coordination, and sleep disturbances. The disease is caused by a loss of function of UBE3A, which encodes a HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase. Here, we generate a Drosophila model for the disease. The results of several experiments show that the functions of human UBE3A and its fly counterpart, dube3a, are similar. First, expression of Dube3a is enriched in the Drosophila nervous system, including mushroom bodies, the seat of learning and memory. Second, we have generated dube3a null mutants, and they appear normal externally, but display abnormal locomotive behavior and circadian rhythms, and defective long-term memory. Third, flies that overexpress Dube3a in the nervous system also display locomotion defects, dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity. Finally, missense mutations in UBE3A alleles of Angelman syndrome patients alter amino acid residues conserved in the fly protein, and when introduced into dube3a, behave as loss-of-function mutations. The simplest model for Angelman syndrome is that in the absence of UBE3A, particular substrates fail to be ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded, accumulate in the brain, and interfere with brain function. We have generated flies useful for genetic screens to identify Dube3a substrates. These flies overexpress Dube3a in the eye or wing and display morphological abnormalities, dependent on the critical catalytic cysteine. We conclude that dube3a mutants are a valid model for Angelman syndrome, with great potential for identifying the elusive UBE3A substrates relevant to the disease. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  neurological disorder | HP_0000707\\n severe mental retardation | HP_0002187\\n mental retardation | HP_0001249\\n loss of motor coordination | HP_0002275\\n sleep disturbances | HP_0002360\\n END',\n",

Most manifestations present in deletion patients are those previously reported. Comparing the clinical data from our and published UPD patients with those with deletions we observed the following: the age of diagnosis is higher in UPD group (average 7 3/12 years), microcephaly is more frequent among deletion patients, UPD children start walking earlier (average age 2 9/12 years), whereas in deletion patients the average is 4 (1/2) years, epilepsy started later in UPD patients (average 5 10/12 years) than in deletion patients (average 1 11/12 years), weight above the 75th centile is reported mainly in UPD patients, complete absence of speech is more common in the deleted (88.9%) than in the UPD patients because half of the children are able to say few words.

These patients display a marked variability in clinical presentation, ranging from very severe disease with numerous tumors at a young age to a relatively mild condition much later in life. To investigate whether this phenotypic heterogeneity is determined by the type of mutation in NF2, we have collected clinical information on 111 NF2 cases from 73 different families on whom we have performed mutation screening in this gene. Sixty-seven individuals (56.2%) from 41 of these kindreds revealed 36 different putative disease-causing mutations. These include 26 proposed protein-truncating alterations (frameshift deletions/insertions and nonsense mutations), 6 splice-site mutations, 2 missense mutations, 1 base substitution in the 3' UTR of the NF2 cDNA, and a single 3-bp in-frame insertion. Seventeen of these mutations are novel, whereas the remaining 19 have been described previously in other NF2 individuals or sporadic tumors. When individuals harboring protein-truncating mutations are compared with cases with single codon alterations, a significant correlation (P < .001) with clinical outcome is observed. Twenty-four of 28 patients with mutations that cause premature truncation of the NF2 protein, schwannomin, present with severe phenotypes. In contrast, all 16 cases from three families with mutations that affect only a single amino acid have mild NF2.

Among 53 sporadic cases, 37 (70%) had molecular deletion, which commonly extended from D15S9 to D15S12, although not all deletions were identical. Of 8 familial cases, 3 sibs from one family had a molecular deletion involving only 2 loci, D15S10 and GABRB3, which define the critical region for AS phenotypes. The parental origin of deletion, both in sporadic and familial cases, was exclusively maternal and consistent with a genomic imprinting hypothesis. Among sporadic and familial cases without deletion, no uniparental disomy was found and most of them were shown to inherit chromosomes 15 from both parents (biparental inheritance). A discrepancy between cytogenetic and molecular deletion was observed in 14 (26%) of 53 patients in whom cytogenetic analysis could be performed.

This case illustrates complex gene-environment interaction, in that increased skin pigmentation in African-Americans is presumably protective against ultraviolet, but not ionizing, radiation. This case and other similar cases in the literature show the importance of considering NBCCS in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with a medulloblastoma, especially before the age of 5 years, and of examining other close relatives for signs of NBCCS to determine the patient's at-risk status.

       " 'Angelman syndrome (AS) results from a lack of maternal contribution from chromosome 15q11-13, arising from de novo deletion in most cases or rarely from uniparental disomy. These families are associated with a low recurrence risk. However, in a minority of families, more than one child is affected. No deletion has been found in these families, except one. The mode of inheritance in these families is autosomal dominant modified by imprinting. Sporadic cases, with no observable deletion, therefore pose a counselling dilemma as there could be a recurrence risk as high as 50%. We present a series of 93 AS patients, showing the relative contribution of these different genetic mechanisms. Eighty-one AS patients were sporadic cases while 12 cases came from six families. Sixty cases had deletions in 15q11-13 detected by a set of highly polymorphic (CA)n repeats markers and conventional RFLPs. Ten sporadic cases plus all 12 familial cases had no detectable deletion. In addition, two cases of de novo deletions occurred in a chromosome 15 carrying a pericentric inversion. In one of these the AS child had a cousin with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) arising from a de novo deletion in an inv(15) inherited from his father. One case arose from a maternal balanced t(9;15)(p24;q15) translocation. There were three cases of uniparental disomy. Five patients were monoallelic for all loci across the minimal AS critical region, but the presence of a deletion cannot be confirmed. In familial cases, all affected sibs inherited the same maternal chromosome 15 markers for the region 15q11-13. Two cases were observed with a de novo deletion starting close to the locus D15S11 (IR4-2R), providing evidence for the development of classical AS with smaller deletions. Cytogenetic analysis proved limited in its ability to detect deletions, detecting only 42 out of 60 cases. However, cytogenetic analysis is still essential to detect chromosomal abnormalities other than deletions such as inversions and balanced translocations since both have an increased risk for deletions. A staged diagnostic strategy based on the use of highly informative (CA)n repeat markers is proposed. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  de novo | HP_0003745\\n mode of inheritance | HP_0000005\\n autosomal dominant | HP_0000006\\n END',\n",

Apparently, most patients are sporadic cases. The genetic mechanism underlying familial AS has remained enigmatic for a long time. Recently, evidence has been emerging suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance of a detectable or undetectable defect in a gene or genes at 15q11-13, subject to genomic imprinting.

However, the genetic defect is still located in this region, as we obtained a maximum lod score of 5.40 for linkage to the GABA receptor locus GABRB3 and the anonymous DNA marker D15S10, which have been mapped within or adjacent to the AS critical region at 15q11-13. The size of the pedigree allowed calculation of an odds ratio in favour of genomic imprinting of 9.25 x 10(5). This family illustrates the necessity of extensive pedigree analysis when considering recurrence risks for relatives of AS patients, those without detectable deletion or disomy in particular. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  sporadic cases | HP_0003745\\n familial AS | HP_0000005\\n autosomal dominant inheritance | HP_0000006\\n END',\n",

Virtually complete ascertainment of cases in the north-west of England was achieved and suggests a population incidence of 1 in 33,000 to 40,000. In the UK as a whole, 150 cases have been identified and been used to study the clinical and genetic features of NF2. The autosomal dominant inheritance of NF2 was confirmed, 49% of cases were assessed as representing new mutations, and the mutation rate was estimated to be 6.5 x 10(-6). Evidence to support a maternal gene effect was found in that age at onset was 18.17 years in 36 maternally inherited cases and 24.5 in 20 paternally inherited cases (p = 0.027). The preponderance of maternally inherited cases was also significant (p = 0.03). Data are presented which suggest that there are two types of NF2, one with later onset and bilateral vestibular schwannomas as the only usual feature, and the other with earlier onset and multiple other tumours.

Cytogenetic findings suggested that the gene mutated in TBS maps to chromosome 16q12.1, where SALL1 (previously known as HSAL1), a human homologue of spalt (sal), is located. SAL is a developmental regulator in Drosophila melanogaster and is conserved throughout evolution. No phenotype has yet been attributed to mutations in vertebrate sal-like genes. The expression patterns of sal-like genes in mouse, Xenopus and the fish Medaka, and the finding that Medaka sal is regulated by Sonic hedgehog (Shh; ref. 11), prompted us to examine SALL1 as a TBS candidate gene. Here we demonstrate that SALL1 mutations cause TBS in a family with vertical transmission of TBS and in an unrelated family with a sporadic case of TBS. Both mutations are predicted to result in a prematurely terminated SALL1 protein lacking all putative DNA binding domains. TBS therefore represents another human developmental disorder caused by mutations in a putative C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  autosomal-dominant | HP_0000006\\n anal, renal, limb and ear anomalies | HP_0004378\\n ear anomalies | HP_0000598\\n sporadic | HP_0003745\\n END',\n",

Our objective was to determine the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis 1 and neurofibromatosis 2, recommendations for the care of patients and their families at diagnosis and during routine follow-up, and the role of DNA diagnostic testing in the evaluation of these disorders.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublished reports from 1966 through 1996 obtained by MEDLINE search and studies presented at national and international meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll studies were reviewed and analyzed by consensus from multiple authors.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeer-reviewed published data were critically evaluated by independent extraction by multiple authors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main results of the review were qualitative and were reviewed by neurofibromatosis clinical directors worldwide through an Internet Web site.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the basis of the information presented in this review, we propose a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 and neurofibromatosis 2. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  Neurofibromatosis | HP_0006746\\n autosomal dominant | HP_0000006\\n tumors | HP_0002664\\n END',\n",

The pregnancy was followed with serial ultrasounds, and the diagnosis was confirmed after birth. The clinical findings in all affected family members are described. A literature survey of prenatally diagnosed cases of multiple joint contractures is presented. These include cases with many different diagnoses. This is the first report of the prenatal diagnosis of distal arthrogryposis type I. It helps to illustrate the variability and prenatal natural history of the condition and the subtlety of the prenatal ultrasound findings. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  distal arthrogryposis | HP_0005684\\n arthrogryposis | HP_0001390\\n prenatally diagnosed cases | HP_0003660\\n multiple joint contractures | HP_0002828\\n joint contractures | HP_0001371\\n variability | HP_0003812\\n END',\n",

The facies had some features of the Potter facies of renal agenesis. One child died soon after birth because of pneumothorax and immature development of the lungs.

       " \"We studied the seizure and polygraphic patterns of 18 patients with Angelman's syndrome. All patients showed movement problems. Eleven patients were also reported to have long-lasting periods of jerky movements. The polygraphic recording showed a myoclonic status epilepticus in nine of them. Seven patients had partial seizures with eye deviation and vomiting, similar to those of childhood occipital epilepsies. These seizures and electroencephalographic patterns suggest that Angelman's syndrome occurs in most of the patients as a nonprogressive, age-dependent myoclonic encephalopathy with a prominent occipital involvement. These findings indicate that, whereas ataxia is a constant symptom in Angelman's syndrome, the occurrence of a transient myoclonic status epilepticus may account for the recurrence of different abnormal movements, namely the jerky ones. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  seizure | HP_0001250\\n movement problems | HP_0100022\\n jerky movements | HP_0007087\\n myoclonic status epilepticus | HP_0002123\\n myoclonic | HP_0001336\\n status epilepticus | HP_0002133\\n partial seizures | HP_0007359\\n eye deviation | HP_0000496\\n vomiting | HP_0002013\\n childhood | HP_0011463\\n epilepsies | HP_0001275\\n electroencephalographic patterns | HP_0002353\\n nonprogressive | HP_0003680\\n nonprogressive, age-dependent myoclonic encephalopathy | HP_0007030\\n encephalopathy | HP_0001298\\n ataxia | HP_0001251\\n END\",\n",
       " \"Angelman's syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are both causes of mental retardation with recognisable, but quite different, clinical phenotypes. Both are associated with deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, of maternal origin in Angelman's and paternal in Prader-Willi. Prader-Willi can arise by inheritance of two chromosomes 15 from the mother and none from the father (uniparental maternal disomy). In 2 patients with Angelman's syndrome we found evidence of uniparental paternal disomy. The phenotypic effects of maternal and paternal disomy of chromosome 15 are very different and inheritance of two normal 15s from one parent does not lead to normal development--strong evidence in man for genomic imprinting, in which the same gene has different effects dependent upon its parental origin. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  mental retardation | HP_0001249\\n END\",\n",
       " 'This study of 47 patients from 11 families with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2) confirms our previously reported association between posterior capsular cataract and NF 2. A highly significant statistical association was found between the presence of posterior capsular lens opacities and the presence of NF 2 as determined by magnetic resonance imaging or pathologic diagnosis. This association was not present for other types of lens opacities that could be the result of age-related or nonspecific changes. When considering the diagnosis of NF 2, this finding now makes it essential to use a careful dilated biomicroscopic examination of the lens to evaluate known, suspected, or at-risk individuals for this potentially early associated manifestation. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  neurofibromatosis | HP_0006746\\n posterior capsular cataract | HP_0100020\\n capsular cataract | HP_0100017\\n cataract | HP_0000518\\n posterior capsular lens opacities | HP_0007787\\n early associated manifestation | HP_0003593\\n END',\n",

       " 'Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an autosomal-dominant multiple neoplasia syndrome that results from mutations in the NF2 tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome 22q. It has a frequency of one in 25,000 livebirths and nearly 100% penetrance by 60 years of age. Half of patients inherit a germline mutation from an affected parent and the remainder acquire a de novo mutation for neurofibromatosis type 2. Patients develop nervous system tumours (schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, astrocytomas, and neurofibromas), peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmological lesions (cataracts, epiretinal membranes, and retinal hamartomas), and cutaneous lesions (skin tumours). Optimum treatment is multidisciplinary because of the complexities associated with management of the multiple, progressive, and protean lesions associated with the disorder. We review the molecular pathogenesis, genetics, clinical findings, and management strategies for neurofibromatosis type 2. \\n\\n##\\n\\n  Neurofibromatosis | HP_0006746\\n autosomal-dominant | HP_0000006\\n multiple neoplasia | HP_0003008\\n neoplasia | HP_0002664\\n de novo | HP_0003745\\n nervous system tumours | HP_0004375\\n schwannomas | HP_0100008\\n meningiomas | HP_0002858\\n ependymomas | HP_0002888\\n astrocytomas | HP_0009592\\n neurofibromas | HP_0001067\\n peripheral neuropathy | HP_0009830\\n ophthalmological lesions | HP_0000478\\n cataracts | HP_0000518\\n epiretinal membranes | HP_0100014\\n retinal hamartomas | HP_0009594\\n cutaneous lesions | HP_0000951\\n skin tumours | HP_0008069\\n END',\n",

The former 2 individuals lacked the ocular and branchial abnormalities normally encountered in this syndrome. However, unilateral renal agenesis was present in the first child, a defect infrequently found in the BOF syndrome. Both the mother and her son also had bilateral supra-auricular sinuses. These defects may represent persistence of the otic vesicle sinus tract. The second child has a mild expression of this condition, among the mildest reported in the literature. The BOFS appears to represent a spectrum involving the development of the optic vesicles, branchial arches, eyes, face, lips, and kidneys.

      "Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) has been recognized as a dominant inherited syndrome. We report 2 cases of TBS. Case 1 was operated on for imperforate anus. Triphalangeal thumb and ear anomalies were remarkable. Deafness was diagnosed when the patient was 6 months old. Anomalies of the semicircular canals and the incus with inculomalleolar fusion were shown when the patient was 3.5 years old. During childhood, recurrent episodes of abdominal pain appeared. The diagnosis of hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE) was made. HANE was familial as the father, the father's brother and the paternal grand mother were also affected. The parents of case 2, a female, are both mildly mentally retarded. This was the first pregnancy of the mother who had short stature. The child had an antepositioned anus, bifid right thumb, large toes, low set ears, microretrognathia and deafness. A (5, 16) translocation was observed in a child with TBS. At the breakpoint in 16q21.1, a gene coding for a transcription factor SALL1 has been identified and it was shown that mutations in the putative zinc finger of SALL1 cause TBS. \n",

The most consistent findings among individuals were overlapping fingers at birth, abnormal digital flexion creases, and foot deformities, including talipes equinovarus and vertical talus. There was marked intrafamilial variation in the expression of DA1A. Linkage mapping of the locus for DA1A suggests that the use of strict diagnostic criteria excludes unaffected individuals rigorously, but can produce incomplete ascertainment of affected individuals. In the context of an affected family, the range of phenotypes consistent with a diagnosis of DA1A needs to be expanded. \n",

      "We present a child with mild to moderate global developmental delay including severe speech impairment, inappropriate happy demeanor, wide-based gait, frequent ear infections with mild hearing loss, deep-set eyes, a wide mouth, widely-spaced teeth, normal head circumference, and no seizures. Results of peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal analysis with GTG banding were normal. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies showed mosaicism for a deletion of probes (D15S10 and SNRPN) from the Angelman syndrome (AS) critical region with approximately 40% of peripheral lymphocytes having the deletion. The deleted chromosome 15 also showed centromeric duplication, which was detected with a D15Z1 probe [46,XX, dic(15)(pter-->q11.1::p11.2-->q11. 1::q13-->qter)]. The same duplication pattern was observed in 30% of the nuclei obtained from a buccal smear. Methylation studies using polymerase chain reaction with sodium bisulfite-treated DNA demonstrated a normal biparental methylation pattern. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case with AS and a FISH detectable deletion in a mosaic pattern. We recommend FISH studies for the detection of mosaicism in the patients with AS clinical findings even if results of the methylation studies are normal. \n",

      "Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by branchial abnormality, hearing loss, and renal anomalies. Recently, the disease gene has been localized to chromosome 8q. Here, we report genetic studies that further refine the disease gene region to a smaller interval and identify several YACs from the critical region. We studied two large, clinically well-characterized BOR families with a set of 13 polymorphic markers spanning the D8S165-D8S275 interval from the chromosome 8q region. Based on multipoint analysis, the highest likelihood for the location of the BOR gene is between markers D8S543 and D8S530, a distance of about 2 cM. YACs that map in the BOR critical region have been identified and characterized by fluorescence in situ hybridization and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A YAC contig, based on the STS content map, that covers a minimum of 4 Mb of human DNA in the critical region of BOR is assembled. This lays the groundwork for the construction of a transcriptional map of this region and the eventual identification of genes involved in BOR syndrome. \n",

It was first identified by Farabee in 1903 (ref. 2), is the first recorded example of a human anomaly with Mendelian autosomal-dominant inheritance and, as such, is cited in most genetic and biological textbooks. Here we show that mutations in IHH, which encodes Indian hedgehog, cause BDA-1. We have identified three heterozygous missense mutations in the region encoding the amino-terminal signaling domain in all affected members of three large, unrelated families. The three mutant amino acids, which are conserved across all vertebrates and invertebrates studied so far, are predicted to be adjacent on the surface of IHH. \n",

      "Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) features bilateral vestibular schwannomas, other benign neural tumors, and cataracts. Patients in some families develop many tumors at an early age and have rapid clinical progression, whereas in other families, patients may not have symptoms until much later and vestibular schwannomas may be the only tumors. The NF2 gene has been cloned from chromosome 22q; most identified germ-line mutations result in a truncated protein and severe NF2. To look for additional mutations and clinical correlations, we used SSCP analysis to screen DNA from 32 unrelated patients. We identified 20 different mutations in 21 patients (66%): 10 nonsense mutations, 2 frameshifts, 7 splice-site mutations, and 1 large in-frame deletion. Clinical information on 47 patients from the 21 families included ages at onset and at diagnosis, numbers of meningiomas, spinal and skin tumors, and presence of cataracts and retinal abnormalities. We compared clinical findings in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations to those with splice-site mutations. When each patient was considered as an independent random event, the two groups differed (P < or =.05) for nearly every variable. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were younger at onset and at diagnosis and had a higher frequency and mean number of tumors, supporting the correlation between nonsense and frameshift mutations and severe NF2. When each family was considered as an independent random event, statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed only for mean ages at onset and at diagnosis. A larger data set is needed to resolve these discrepancies. We observed retinal hamartomas and/or epiretinal membranes in nine patients from five families with four different nonsense mutations. This finding, which may represent a new genotype-phenotype correlation, merits further study. \n",

This implies that the child is able to respond to the external world but has no internal conflict or difficulty in dealing with it. This is a transient condition and may be a normal response to an otherwise distressing situation. So, if we are not told about the transient condition, we should suspect mental retardation resulting from a brain damage (which can be transient or not transient), and this should alert us to the possibility of Angelman syndrome. We should also suspect other syndromes presenting with microcephaly, such as Prader-Willi syndrome and Duane syndrome, which have a happy disposition as a main symptom. Finally, we should suspect other mental retardation syndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, which has mental retardation as a main symptom, and we should suspect other syndromes presenting with ataxic movements, such as Prader-Willi syndrome and Duane syndrome, which have mental retardation as a main symptom.\n",

      "The diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) has seldom been made in infants because the previously described characteristic manifestations usually are not apparent until after age 2 years. We describe 4 AS patients, one of whom has oculocutaneous albinism, who were less than 2 years old when first evaluated. All 4 have deletions of the region q11.2-q13 of chromosome 15. In the 3 cases in which parents were available for study the deleted chromosome 15 was maternally derived, as determined by cytological markers. All of the patients presented with severe to profound global developmental delay and postnatal-onset microcephaly; they had seizures, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, and hyperkinesis. All were hypopigmented as compared to their relatives. Each had eye abnormalities; all had choroidal pigment hypoplasia. None were initially described as having an abnormal appearance. We believe that AS is far more common than previously thought and present these 4 children to emphasize the manifestations that may be helpful in making the diagnosis in the young patient. We also emphasize the hypopigmentation that patients with AS frequently have, including what we think is the first reported case of albinism and AS. \n",

Ube3a is imprinted with silencing of the paternal allele in hippocampus and cerebellum in mice. We found that the phenotype of mice with maternal deficiency (m-/p+) for Ube3a resembles human AS with motor dysfunction, inducible seizures, and a context-dependent learning deficit. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was severely impaired in m-/p+ mice despite normal baseline synaptic transmission and neuroanatomy, indicating that ubiquitination may play a role in mammalian LTP and that LTP may be abnormal in AS. The cytoplasmic abundance of p53 was increased in postmitotic neurons in m-/p+ mice and in AS, providing a potential biochemical basis for the phenotype through failure to ubiquitinate and degrade various effectors. \n",

      "A young girl 12 old, sent to us for obesity, and coxa-epiphysiolysis showed signs of mental retardation and bilateral thumb ankylosis. The fact that the mother was also affected by both of these signs, led to a more detailed genetic research. The latter revealed that not only the daughter, the mother, but also their own mother and may be, the sister, the grand-mother and the great-aunt of the patient had a retardation, a slight dysmorphia, a type A brachydactylia, signs of obesity and an identical ankylosis of both thumbs. This vertical inheritance, affecting apparently females only, but not associated with a high rate of miscarriage, has, it seems, never been reported.

      "Several pedigrees with 19 new cases of the earpits-deafness syndrome (McK +12510) [28] are presented. Mention is made of clinical findings obtained in audiometric and vestibular studies, studies of renal function and configuration and polytomographic studies of the labyrinth, and results of exploratory tympanotomies are discussed. The literature is reviewed and the features found in 138 cases and in our 19 cases are presented. The earpits-deafness syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder in which affected individuals may have sensorineural, conductive or mixed hearing loss, preauricular pits, structural defects of the outer, middle and inner ear, lacrimal duct stenosis, branchial fistulas or cysts of the second branchial arch, and renal anomalies ranging from mild hypoplasia to complete absence. Not all the features of the syndrome are expressed in all carriers of the gene. Pits, branchial clefts and hearing loss are frequently expressed. The incidence of renal malformation is higher, as mentioned earlier in the literature. The poor results of exploratory tympanotomies are discussed. On the basis of personal observations as well as in view of data from the literature it is maintained that the BOR (branchio-oto-renal dysplasia) syndrome [12,30-32] and the BO (branchio-oto dysplasia) syndrome are in fact the same affection. It is also maintained that no separate syndromes can be distinguished on the basis of the type of hearing loss. The present knowledge of the syndrome is summarized in terms of the information available for genetic counselling. \n",

      "Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) must be suspected in patients presenting with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma at a young age who are therefore at theoretical risk of developing bilateral disease. We identified 45 patients aged 30 years or less at the onset of symptoms of a unilateral vestibular schwannoma. Molecular genetic analysis of the NF2 gene was completed on peripheral blood samples in all 45 and on 28 tumour samples. No pathogenic NF2 mutations were identified in any of the blood samples. NF2 point mutations were identified in 21/28 (75%) tumour samples and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 21/28 (75%) tumour samples. Both mutational hits were identified in 18/28 (65%) tumour samples. In one multilobular tumour, one (presumably first hit) mutation was confirmed which was common to different foci of the tumour, while the second mutational event differed between foci. The molecular findings in this patient were consistent with somatic mosaicism for NF2 and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed with the presence of two meningiomas on a follow up MRI scan. A further patient developed a contralateral vestibular schwannoma on a follow up MRI scan in whom neither of the truncating mutations in the vestibular schwannoma were present in blood. It is important when counselling patients with unilateral vestibular schwannomas to identify (1) those at risk of bilateral disease, (2) those at risk of developing other tumours, and (3) other family members at risk of developing NF2. Comparing tumour and blood DNA cannot exclude mosaicism in the index case and cannot, therefore, be used to predict those at risk of developing further tumours. However, identification of both mutations or one mutation plus LOH in the tumour and exclusion of those mutations in the blood samples of the sibs or offspring of the affected case may be sufficient to render further screening unnecessary in these relatives. \n",

Clinical reassessment and the use of molecular studies, including methylation analysis with an SNRPN probe, microsatellite analyses of D15S11, GABRB3 and D15S113 loci, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the SNRPN and GABRB3 probes, are consistent with a diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) due to paternal isodisomy.

      "Bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis (BANF) is a severe autosomal dominant disorder involving development of multiple tumours of the nervous system including meningiomas, gliomas, neurofibromas and particularly bilateral acoustic neuromas. We have used genetic linkage analysis with DNA markers to establish that the defective gene causing BANF is on chromosome 22, and is therefore distinct from the gene for the von Recklinghausen form of neurofibromatosis, which maps to chromosome 17. Linked DNA markers will be particularly valuable in BANF, facilitating early detection of tumours and thereby permitting more effective surgical intervention. In view of the reported loss of genes on chromosome 22 in meningiomas and acoustic neuromas, the genetic localization of the primary BANF defect strongly supports the concept that the disease locus encodes a 'tumour suppressor' gene. Isolation of this gene should provide insights into the pathogenesis of acoustic neuromas and other nervous system tumours, as well as into the control of proliferation and differentiation of neural crest cells. \n",

      "We compared epilepsy phenotypes with genotypes of Angelman syndrome (AS), including chromosome 15q11-13 deletions (class I), uniparental disomy (class II), methylation imprinting abnormalities (class III), and mutation in the UBE3A gene (class IV). Twenty patients were prospectively selected based on clinical cytogenetic and molecular diagnosis of AS. All patients had 6 to 72 hours of closed-circuit television videotaping and digitized electroencephalogrpahic (EEG) telemetry. Patients from all genotypic classes had characteristic EEGs with diffuse bifrontally dominant high-amplitude 1- to 3-Hz notched or triphasic or polyphasic slow waves, or slow and sharp waves. Class I patients had severe intractable epilepsy, most frequently with atypical absences and myoclonias and less frequently with generalized extensor tonic seizures or flexor spasms. Epileptic spasms were recorded in AS patients as old as 41 years. Aged-matched class II, III, and IV patients had either no epilepsy or drug-responsive mild epilepsy with relatively infrequent atypical absences, myoclonias, or atonic seizures. In conclusion, maternally inherited chromosome 15q11-13 deletions produce severe epilepsy. Loss-of-function UBE3A mutations, uniparental disomy, or methylation imprint abnormalities in AS are associated with relatively mild epilepsy. Involvement of other genes in the chromosome 15q11-13 deletion, such as GABRB3, may explain severe epilepsy in AS. \n",

She had two seizures at 26 and 28 months of age, and she has been seizure-free since then. She is now off medications. However, the primary concern was noted at the age of three years when she had an expressive language delay. Her cognitive abilities, in general, were reduced. She was evaluated by a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ADHD and was started on medications. She also had an estimated IQ of 76. Her mother also noticed that she has frequent sleep panic attacks. Her parents are nonconsanguineous with another mildly affected daughter. Her father also has mild cognitive impairment, and there are multiple family members affected on the paternal side. Physical examination revealed mild hypertelorism and hypopigmentation on the back, and other examinations were within normal limits. Her growth parameters at 9 years of age were weight 44.2 kg ( >97th percentile), height 150 cm (>97th percentile, +2.64 SD) and head circumference 55.5 cm (>99th percentile, + 2.68 SD).

He was developmentally normal until two years of age when he started to regress by losing his ability to speak. He sat with support at 4 months, talked by 9 months, and walked at 13 months. He is currently nonexpressive verbally, although he does seem to retain some verbal comprehension. He started to have seizures at 3 years of age. His seizures seem to be a combination of absence seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures which can occur even while he is walking and causing him to fall on the floor. He has an older sister who has been through the same course. His past medical history is noteworthy for a herniorrhaphy at age 4 months of age. His physical examination revealed appendicular hypertonia and hyporeflexia. He does not have dysmorphic features, and other examinations were within normal limits. His and his sister’s brain MRI were reported as normal. An experimental PET scan was done for him and it showed increased radiotracer binding in the bilateral basal ganglia and right hippocampus.\n",

She was noted at birth to have a cleft palate. She has had recurrent aspiration pneumonia that began within the second week of life led to several hospital admissions. Developmentally, she has a global developmental delay affecting all domains. She can roll over and hold her milk bottle, but she cannot sit, stand or say any word. Her parents are nonconsanguineous, and other siblings are healthy. On examination, her dysmorphic features include hypertelorism, excessive forehead hair, broad thumbs, three phalanges thumbs and bilateral prominent fingertip pads. Her growth parameters at 11 months of age were weight 5.1 KG and height 64 cm; both were below the 1st percentile. Her neurological assessment showed hyperreflexia and hypotonia, but other examinations were within normal limits. Brain MRI and EEG were reported to be normal. \n",
